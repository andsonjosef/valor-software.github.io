With the help\n    of this article, we'll set up your GCP environment to work in tandem with Terraform. I'll guide you through the\n    setup of a basic cluster. For this, I picked the services that I use daily within my DevOps routine, since they are\n    optimal for your typical project setup. Let me explain myself here! By typical I mean common projects that are\n    natural (habitual) for your company or industry. In this case, I bet you'd appreciate a chance to build the\n    environment once and clone it for future projects. That's exactly the way you can go with the services I offer\n    below. So, once you learn the basics for the project setup in this stack, you'll be able to run new ones in the\n    cloud in no time.<br></p>\n    <h3><strong>Automated setup with Terraform</strong><br></h3>\n    <p> When we\n        need to set up a cloud infrastructure for the project, we want to make it quickly. That's when automation tools\n        come\n        to help. <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Terraform</a> is one of the instruments that\n        serve for automated setup, and it is compatible with more than 70 providers, which is beyond handy. Besides,\n        Terraform is pretty straightforward to get along with thanks to its declarative language. You don't need to get\n        used\n        to a completely different CLI, like in cases when you switch to another cloud provider. </p>\n    <p> Why I suggest\n        picking Terraform from the great variety of services is because it's perfect for creating reusable\n        infrastructures.\n        You can also clone the existing infrastructure and apply it to your next project, with small alterations if\n        needed.\n        This benefit of reusability, together with the security that Terraform provides, makes it a first-choice\n        technology\n        for solving my daily tasks. BTW, it's also the right place for keeping electronic keys and hidden or encrypted\n        variables. </p>\n    <p> Another good point is that Terraform allows for managing several cloud infrastructures\n        from different providers in parallel with minimal time and effort spent. </p>\n    <p> In this article, I'll lead\n        you through setting up infrastructure on Google Cloud using Terraform, so buckle up! </p>\n    <h3><strong>Kubernetes\n        on Google Cloud Platform</strong></h3>\n    <p> Being one of the native Google products, Kubernetes is integrated\n        into GCP quite as is, with no alterations. So you can conveniently set it up and manage it through the GCP CLI\n        or\n        with the help of external instruments like Terraform.<br></p>\n    <h3><strong>Before you begin<br></strong>\n    </h3>\n    <ol>\n        <li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects\" target=\"_blank\">Create\n            a Google Cloud project</a></li>\n\n    </ol>\n\n    <ol start=\"2\">\n        <li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys\" target=\"_blank\">Create\n            a service account key</a> and download it in JSON format\n        </li>\n\n    </ol>\n    <h3><strong>Terraform and GCP setup step-by-step<br></strong></h3>\n    <p> Create a new directory for the\n        project and create a main.tf file for the Terraform config,&nbsp and populate it with the following content:<br>\n    </p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">\nprovider \"google\" <span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n    <span class=\"kwd\">credentials</span> = file(\"CREDENTIALS_FILE.json\")\n    <span class=\"kwd\">project</span> = \"your-project\"\n    <span class=\"kwd\">region</span> = \"us-west1\"\n<span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n    </pre>\n\n    <p> Before we jump to the next step of creating a configuration file, we should remember to keep data (e.g.\n        keys, project names) in separate files. This way we ensure project security and give ourselves a chance to reuse\n        the configuration in the future. So, locate the project name, region, and credentials file in a separate file\n        with variables. </p>\n    <p> First, create a variables.tf file and declare variables for it:<br></p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">\nvariable \"credentials\" <span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n    <span class=\"kwd\">type</span> = string\n<span class=\"pun\">}</span>\nvariable \"project\"<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n    <span class=\"kwd\">type</span> = string\n<span class=\"pun\">}</span>\nvariable \"region\"<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n    <span class=\"kwd\">type</span> = string\n<span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n    </pre>\n\n    <p> Add the variables' values to secrets.tfvars:<br></p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">credentials</span> = \"CREDENTIALS_FILE.json\"\n<span class=\"kwd\">project</span> = \"your-project\"\n<span class=\"kwd\">region</span> = \"us-west1\"\n    </pre>\n\n    <p> Then format your main.tf file like so:<br></p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">\nprovider  \"google\"<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n    <span class=\"kwd\">credentials</span> = file(var.credentials)\n    <span class=\"kwd\">project</span> = var.project\n    <span class=\"kwd\">region</span> = var.region\n<span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n    </pre>\n\n    <p> Now, when your variables are safe, you'll be able to pick the needed files with variables instead of\n        repeatedly typing in new data in the main file. </p>\n    <p> With the `<em>terraform init</em>` command,\n        you're pulling up modules that you will need to proceed with further steps. </p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">terraform init</pre>\n    <p> If you see this message, it's a success! Hurray!<br></p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">Terraform has been initialised!</pre>\n    <p> For the next step, you add variables to the variables.tf file:<br></p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">\nvariable \"cluster_name\"<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n    <span class=\"kwd\">type</span> = string\n<span class=\"pun\">}</span>\nvariable \"cluster_zone\"<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n    <span class=\"kwd\">type</span> = string\n<span class=\"pun\">}</span>\nvariable \"app_name\"<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n    <span class=\"kwd\">type</span> = string\n<span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n    </pre>\n    <p> Before creating a cluster, you should first add variables describing this particular cluster to the\n        secrets.tfvars file: </p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">\ncluster_name = “cluster-1”\ncluster_zone = “us-west1-a”\napp_name = “test”\n    </pre>\n    <p> Now add the cluster configuration to your main.tf file:<br></p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">\nresource \"google_container_cluster\" \"cluster-1\"<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n    name =  var.cluster_name\n    location =  var.cluster_zone\n    initial_node_count = 3\n    node_config\n<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n    labels =<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n        app = var.app_name\n    <span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n        tags = [\"app\", var.app_name]\n    <span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n    timeouts<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n        create = \"30m\"\n        update = \"40m\"\n    <span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n<span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n    </pre>\n    <p> In the configuration, you define the cluster's name, its location, and the number of nodes and their\n        labels. The default namespace is the place where you create a cluster. </p>\n    <p> To operate with the\n        cluster and its components conveniently, you need to create an output.tf file, where you'll add variables that\n        will be displayed after running the `<em>terraform apply</em>` command. You can use them later by calling them\n        during configuration.<br></p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">\noutput \"cluster\"<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n    value = google_container_cluster.cluster-1.name\n<span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n    </pre>\n    <p> Now add a new resource which is deployment:<br></p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">            \nresource \"kubernetes_deployment\" \"example\"<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>            \n    metadata<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>            \n        name = \"terraform-example\"            \n        labels =<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n            app = var.app_name            \n        <span class=\"pun\">}</span>           \n    <span class=\"pun\">}</span>            \n    spec<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n        replicas = 3            \n        selector<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n            match_labels =<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>            \n                app = var.app_name            \n            <span class=\"pun\">}</span>            \n        <span class=\"pun\">}</span>            \n        template<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n            metadata<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>            \n                labels =<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>            \n                    app = var.app_name            \n                <span class=\"pun\">}</span>           \n            <span class=\"pun\">}</span>            \n            spec<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n                container<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n                    image = \"nginx:1.7.8\"            \n                    name  = \"example\"            \n                    resources<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>            \n                        limits =<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n                            cpu = \"0.5\"            \n                            memory = \"512Mi\"            \n                        <span class=\"pun\">}</span>            \n                        requests =<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n                            cpu = \"250m\"            \n                            memory = \"50Mi\"            \n                        <span class=\"pun\">}</span>            \n                    <span class=\"pun\">}</span>            \n                    liveness_probe<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n                        http_get<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>\n                            path = \"/\"            \n                            port = 80            \n                            http_header<span class=\"pun\"> &#123;</span>            \n                                name  = \"X-Custom-Header\"            \n                                value = \"Awesome\"            \n                            <span class=\"pun\">}</span> \n                        <span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n                        initial_delay_seconds = 3\n                        period_seconds = 3\n                    <span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n                <span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n            <span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n        <span class=\"pun\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"pun\">}</span>            \n<span class=\"pun\">}</span>        \n    </pre>\n    <p> In the deployment configuration, you specify the number of replicas, tags, labels, an image that we're\n        going to use, as well as internal resources. Finally, you have it all ready for the first launch and go with\n        this command: </p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">            terraform plan -var-file=secrets.tfvars        </pre>\n    <p> In this way, you check if the configuration is created properly and if you're satisfied with the range of\n        resources. </p>\n    <p> When you're quite sure that everything is correct, it's time for the `<em>terraform\n        apply</em>` command: </p>\n    <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted\">            terraform apply -var-file=secrets.tfvars        </pre>\n    <p> And don't forget to specify the file with variables! At this stage, you'll have to confirm your actions by\n        running a `<em>yes</em>` command. Terraform will build your new GKE cluster on GCP. After the cluster is\n        created, you'll see the output list. </p>\n    <p> For your convenience, in the future, you can split the\n        config file into a few separate files. Place the provider block in the providers.tf file, and a\n        \"google_container_cluster\" block вЂ” in the cluster.tf file. <br></p>\n    <h3><strong>Good\n        job!<br></strong></h3>\n    <p> You're almost done with your journey, the cluster is up and running, and you\n        can be (ugh) proud of yourself!&nbsp </p>\n    <p> For your future projects, you'll be able to add more metrics\n        and parameters when creating a resource. This will help you adjust your configuration for solving every\n        particular task. </p>\n    <h3><strong>Useful links<br></strong></h3>\n    <ul>\n        <li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects\">Create a Google Cloud\n            project</a></li>\n\n        <li><a href=\"http://about:blank\">Create a service account key using the Google Cloud Console</a><br></li>\n\n    </ul>\n\n</div>\n"
