# Add new article

<p>
From the start you should create a copy of development branch (default branch). Steps to it are: </p>

1. Be sure the development branch is already set up
<img class="mx-auto center-block d-block" alt="example" src="../img/instruction/4.png">

2. In the field 'Find or create a branch ...' put the name of your new branch.
3. Click 'create branch: name of your branch'
<img class="mx-auto center-block d-block" alt="example" src="../img/instruction/5.png">

Now your own branch is ready for work.

<p>
Firstly for adding new article we need to add article's title to the general list. We need it for scully routes. To achieve it you should visit file articles.list.ts.
 
- Path for this file is:  /apps/valor-software-site/src/assets/blog

when you found such file in our github repository you should flow the [steps for editing github document](#File-editing-in-github). These steps are described downer.

In this file you can see an array of all articles on our site, you need to add a new one on the first position.

As ex. title of new site is 'test title for new article'. So you open document articles.list.ts and add your title
The result will be

    export const articleIdList = ['test title for new article','Announcing strategic partnership with Zack Jackson, the Module Federation inventor', 'Implementing WebSockets plugin for NativeScript using React Native', 'TagTide library: make your HTML editor-friendly and more', 'Diving into seeking issue with MP3 files', 'Performance Testing via Artillery.io', 'ARC – a new weapon against accessibility bugs', 'Setting up your project on GCP fast using Terraform and Kubernetes', 'ngx-bootstrap v7.0.0 is officially released!', 'How to deploy Firebase Preview Channels on Travis CI', 'Scully Helped us Reach a 99 Lighthouse Score for a B2C Platform', 'Designing Aggregator App from A to Z – Part 2', '_Designing Aggregator App from A to Z — Part 1', 'Multi-highlighting for DraftJS', 'New year, new Valor, new you', 'Incorporating user research on live projects — Part 4', 'Incorporating user research on live projects — Part 3', 'Incorporating user research on live projects — Part 2', 'Incorporating user research on live projects — Part 1', 'Why you might want to switch to Time and Material from Fixed Price', "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): a QA Engineer's Guide", 'Career Path for a Flat-structured company', 'JSON Web Token Authorization with Access and Refresh Tokens in Angular Application with Node.js Server', 'Testing iOS App Vulnerabilities with Jailbreaking. Part 1.', 'Benefits of Agile to Business and Team', 'Valor Software Named Top Development Company in Ukraine by Clutch', 'Testing with Protractor: how to fix synchronization issues', 'Hacktoberfest 2019 is coming, and ngx-bootstrap strives for your attention!', 'The 4 biggest lessons we learned while building a startup product as an outsource company', 'Angular and SEO: Structured Data for Rich Snippets', 'ngx-bootstrap: Angular Ivy is here', 'Webflow custom code snippets you would use. Episode 1', 'Testing Canvas could be easier', 'Case study of Applitools or not only Cypress cross-browser testing', 'Figma as a presentation tool: Unifying templates', 'Cypress testing: Running tests in parallel', 'Quality Assured: What It Really Takes To Test Open Source Libraries', 'Figma Vs Sketch: Text alignment comparison', 'Como o Scully nos ajudou a atingir 99 pontos no Lighthouse para uma plataforma B2C'];
</p>

<p>
For displaying one article we need two files. <br>One file contains technical characters of article and article's author. This file should be with .json extension. It should be located in folder by path /apps/valor-software-site/src/assets/blog/articles.<br>
The second file contains content of the article in adoc format. This file should be with .adoc extension. It should be located in folder by path apps/valor-software-site/src/assets/blog/adoc.<br>
Both these files should have the same filename and different extensions.
</p>

Information how to create new files in github you can find in [steps for creating github document](#File-creating-in-github).


### File naming
<p>
Naming of articles files depends on amount of articles. The oldest article start from 1. So when we are adding a new article we should dedicate tha last number in the folder adoc or articles and add 1 point.

Ex. the last article is 38, so the new article will have filename 39 (38 + 1). As a result we should have two new files:
 
- in folder /apps/valor-software-site/src/assets/blog/articles file <strong>39.json</strong>
- in folder /apps/valor-software-site/src/assets/blog/adoc file <strong>39.adoc</strong>
</p>

### Structure of file with technical characters of article and article's author
Theses files can contains such fields: 

- **author** (the field is required, the format of field is simple string);
- **domains** (the field is required, the format of field is array of string. This field is used for articles sorting on blog page);
- **language** (the field is required, available values are 'en' or 'pt'. The value depends on the language of article);
- **bgImg** (the field is required, it should contain the string with url path of background image for article);
- **title** (the field is required, the format of field is simple string);
- **date** (the field is required, the format of field is string. There should be value as ex. Fri Apr 1 2022, so weekday month date year. The correct names of months and week days you can find downer);
- **authorImg** (the field is optional, it should contain the string with url path of author's image);
- **position** (the field is optional, it should contain the author's position in company as ex. 'Marketing Content Manager
